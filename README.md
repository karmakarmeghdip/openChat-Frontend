# pChat (alpha)

> A quick, (soon) disposable and decentralized messaging web application.

Created using Svelte, SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, Skeleton, and Gun.

The relay server for Gun is hosted at: https://pchat-relay-test.shahank.repl.co

This is subject to change in the future.

Note: The ap UI is currently optimized for mobile. Desktop UI is kinda stretchy, so don't mind it too much.
